R 2/17/2026:

Alright, I think specialty units are stored in this location. 
A, this is where you should put our Trogdor.cfg.

Units already built into the game (in our case, Human loyalist army) require no special files built into add-on. They can be accessed directly by their character name.

Be careful, because some units' files are named for both their faction and their unit type. For example, "Loyalist_Bowman.cfg" would be accessed in code as simply "Bowman."

You can see all built-in unit filed under data/core/units.

Side note, discovered accidentally while making this README:
Files in Wesnoth may not have blank spaces in their names.
